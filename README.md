The “node_modules.zip” file contains the newest Bootstrap 4 release, but compressed to be committed on GitHub. The file “package-lock.json” is used by npm for source control. Everything else is source for the website.

If you want to make your own changes to the website, make sure to unzip “node_modules.zip” and leave it in the main directory.
